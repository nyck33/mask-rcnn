# mask-rcnn

Putting the pyimage code from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/19/mask-r-cnn-with-opencv/ into a Colab compatible `ipynb` notebook.

Basically substituted command line arguments with `GLOBAL VARIABLES` and `strings`.  

Works as is but it did not track the tennis ball in a TV broadcast so looking into retraining the network on tennis ball images or transfer learning using the COCO weights.
